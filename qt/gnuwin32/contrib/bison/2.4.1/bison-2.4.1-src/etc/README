* bench.pl
A primitive Perl script to run benches.  Currently its only bench is
the usual calculator: it has a lightweight processing part (but not
null), so it is really emphasizing the cost of the whole parsing
(including scanning and I/O).

Set the envvars BISON and CC to the programs and flags you want to
use.  They default to bison and gcc.  To run a non-installed bison
from a tarball built in _build, I suggest the following.

     BISON=_build/tests/bison CC='gcc -O2' ./bench.pl

(The _build/tests/bison wrapper makes sure that _build/src/bison will
use the tarballs' skeletons, not those already installed as a
straightforward use of _build/src/bison would.)
